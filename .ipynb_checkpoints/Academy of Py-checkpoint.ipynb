Yet, I find it problematic that readers will place too much power on the column reporting Overall Passing Rate.  It is a misleading figure because the value has been extrapolated.  It isn't simply reporting on raw data.  Instead, it is counting the number of students who have met an arbitrary academic goalpost out of the number of students who comprise the total school poulation.  This practice favors charter schools and therefore dramaticizes those schools as dominating in academics."
